<p>The goal of today is continue to develop your comfort with working with, analyzing, and visualizing data using Tableau Public. For the purposes of today, you’re going to be using a dataset recently published by some lame professor at CU Denver: <a href="https://cblevins.github.io/us-post-offices/">US Post Offices</a>.</p>

<p>By the end of class, your aim is to produce a visualization that:</p>

<h2 id="get-to-know-the-data">Get to know the data</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Take a few minutes to scan through <a href="https://cblevins.github.io/us-post-offices/">the data website</a> and in particular look at the section of the data biography <a href="https://cblevins.github.io/us-post-offices/data-biography/#whats-in-the-data:~:text=What%E2%80%99s%20in%20the%20data%3F">“What’s in the data?”</a>.</li>
  <li>Download the files: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">us-post-offices-random-coords</code> (your main data file) and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">us-post-offices-data-dictionary</code> (metadata about that file) from <a href="https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/NUKCNA">Harvard Dataverse</a>, saving them into your class folder on your computer. Hint: you want both of these to be downloaded as CSV files, which you can do by clicking the Access File icon and then clicking Original File Format (Comma Separated Values).</li>
  <li>Open <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">us-post-offices-data-dictionary.csv</code> on your computer and familiarize yourself with the different columns in the main dataset <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">us-post-offices-random-coords</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="explore-the-data-in-tableau-public">Explore the data in Tableau Public</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Connect to the data source on your computer, which should be downloaded as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">us-post-offices-random-coords.csv</code>.</li>
  <li>Spend a few minutes dragging and dropping different Dimension and Measures onto a worksheet so you can start to get a feel for the data.</li>
  <li>Try to use Tableau to answer the following question: in what year did the state of Colorado experience the largest number of post office closures? How many post offices closed that year?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="visualize-the-data">Visualize the data</h2>

<p>Sheet 1:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Choose a state OTHER than Colorado</li>
  <li>Make a bar chart showing how many new post offices were established each year only for the state you selected (hint: use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Filters</code> tool)</li>
  <li>Annotate the “peak” of the graph - ie. the year when the most post offices opened in the state.</li>
  <li>Change the labels for the Y axis and X axis to better explain them to a reader</li>
</ul>

<p>Sheet 2:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Make a map of post offices</li>
  <li>Only show post offices from one state of your choosing on the map using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Filters</code> tool.</li>
  <li>Use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Pages</code> feature to allow a user to “flip” through and see new post offices that were established each year (play around with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Show history</code> feature)</li>
  <li>Add information about the post office’s name, year it opened, and year it closed in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Tooltip</code> so that a user can click on a point and get this information.</li>
  <li>Color all the post offices that have semi-random coordinates light blue. Hint: use the RandomCoordinatesFlag field.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="publish-the-data-online">Publish the data online</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Embed your map into a new post on your Wordpress sandbox site. You can use <a href="https://youtu.be/LVmpQ2c0fmg?t=269">these instructions</a> or try to do the following:
    <ul>
      <li>Make a new post or page in Wordpress</li>
      <li>Insert a new block and make sure its type is set to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Custom HTML</code></li>
      <li>Publish your Tableau Public workbook online</li>
      <li>Open your Tableau Public workbook through your browser and click on the Share icon in the bottom right (3 circles with lines connecting them).</li>
      <li>Click the embed code text book and copy it</li>
      <li>Paste it into your Wordpress Custom HTML block. It should look like a bunch of jumbled text that starts with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;div class=</code>. This is the Javascript code that is going to allow you to display your Tableau visualization inside a webpage.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If it’s not working for you ask your classmates or Professor Blevins for help.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="bonus-tableau-practice">Bonus Tableau Practice</h2>

<p>Try to create a chart/map that answers the following questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What are some of the most common names for post offices in the dataset?</li>
  <li>Which states had the most post offices operating within them during the 1900s? Make a map with each state shaded according to how many post offices operated in that state during the 1900s.</li>
  <li>In what year did the first post office open in Alaska? What was its name?</li>
</ul>
