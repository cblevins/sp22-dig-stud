<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p><a href="https://timeline.knightlab.com/">Timeline.js</a> is a lightweight, popular tool for creating web-based timelines. It doesn‚Äôt allow a ton of customization but it has a comparatively shallow learning curve. Here is an example of a historian‚Äôs timeline built with this tool: <a href="http://teaching.erinbush.org/f17h390/donner-party-timeline/">http://teaching.erinbush.org/f17h390/donner-party-timeline/</a></p>

<p>In this exercise, you‚Äôll make a collaborative timeline of events in the history of feminism in the United States.</p>

<h3 id="part-i-get-to-know-the-data">Part I: Get to Know the Data</h3>

<p>You‚Äôre going to collaboratively create a timeline of a handful of events in the history of first-, second-, third-, and fourth-wave feminism in the United States. You‚Äôll be using Wikipedia as your major source of information, which helpfully has a different pages dedicated to each of these waves.</p>

<ul>
  <li>First-Wave Feminism: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-wave_feminism#Timeline">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-wave_feminism#Timeline</a></li>
  <li>Second-Wave Feminism: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_second-wave_feminism">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_second-wave_feminism</a></li>
  <li>Third-Wave Feminism: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third-wave_feminism#Timeline">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third-wave_feminism#Timeline</a></li>
  <li>Fourth-Wave Feminism: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth-wave_feminism#Timeline">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth-wave_feminism#Timeline</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Divide up the pages in your group. Each of you needs to familiarize yourself with the data. What kind of events does it include? How is the information formatted?</p>

<p>You‚Äôre going to then use an existing template that I started for you: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mlY8Pe2M_Bc6nvoJEpNxi6plwu_Od0CvuqN-HxQtNPI/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mlY8Pe2M_Bc6nvoJEpNxi6plwu_Od0CvuqN-HxQtNPI/edit?usp=sharing</a>.</p>

<p>Look at the spreadsheet. As a group, <strong>make sure everyone knows what each column means</strong>. If you can‚Äôt figure one of them out, ask me.</p>

<h3 id="part-ii-add-the-data">Part II: Add the Data</h3>

<p>Each person then chooses <strong>two events</strong> from their respective page to add to the timeline. Begin adding as much information as you can into each column.</p>

<p>Before moving to Part III, make sure everyone is finished and compare your different rows. Are there discrepancies between them? If so, how would you resolve them?</p>

<h3 id="part-iii-present-the-data">Part III: Present the Data</h3>

<p>Follow the instructions on this page to publish and generate your timeline: <a href="https://timeline.knightlab.com/#make">https://timeline.knightlab.com/#make</a>. Use the Share Link to preview what the timeline looks like and then change the Google Spreadsheet to debug anything that doesn‚Äôt look right.</p>

<p>Now you‚Äôre going to embed the timeline into your personal ‚Äúsandbox‚Äù website in Wordpress. Go to the following tutorial and follow the instructions <em>starting with</em> ‚ÄúEmbedding Your Timeline into your WordPress Site‚Äù: <a href="http://teaching.erinbush.org/tutorial-creating-narrative-timeline-timeline-js/">http://teaching.erinbush.org/tutorial-creating-narrative-timeline-timeline-js/</a></p>

<p>Make sure everyone in the group has successfully managed to embed the group timeline in their sandbox. Help each other out if you‚Äôre getting stuck!</p>
