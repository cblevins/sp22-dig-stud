I",<p>Today you will be learning the basics of how to create a website using Wordpress, one of the most popular platforms for building websites.</p>

<h2 id="personal-website-warm-up">Personal Website Warm-Up</h2>

<p>In your group, divide up the following personal websites. Each person take a few minutes to go through a professional website from different people who will either be speaking to our class or who are involved with the Digital Studies Certificate:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://carolineklibanoff.com/">https://carolineklibanoff.com/</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://abbymullen.org/">http://abbymullen.org/</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://johntinnell.com/">http://johntinnell.com/</a></li>
</ol>

<p>Go through the website and think about what kind of information it includes, how it is organized, what message it is sending about the person.</p>

<p>Once you’ve had a chance to explore your individual website, compare notes across the different websites (pull each of them up on your own machine):</p>

<ul>
  <li>What are the similarities and differences in terms of content?</li>
  <li>What are similarities and differences in terms of design and layout?</li>
  <li>What one is more appealing or informative to you as a viewer - let’s say you’re thinking about taking a class with one of them or want to do some kind of project with them - what is helpful and what isn’t? It’s okay to be honest. :)</li>
</ul>
