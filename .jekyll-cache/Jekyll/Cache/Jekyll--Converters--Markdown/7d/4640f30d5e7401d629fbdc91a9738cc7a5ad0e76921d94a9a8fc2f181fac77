I"Ì<p>You‚Äôre going to submit your first homework of the semester using a Jupyter Notebook. First create a new directory within your class folder called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">homework</code> and then save a new Jupyter Notebook in that directory with the filename: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">yourlastname-week-04-homework.ipynb</code>. Please use this naming convention for all of your homework submissions, as this will help me keep track of them.</p>

<p>You are going to write some Python code to generate information about the historical figure Lucy Parsons. In Step 1 you are going to manually enter information about Parsons as variables. In the rest of the steps you are going to <em>calculate</em> an answer using variables and operations, then print ou the results using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">print()</code> function. Refer back to the <a href="/sp22-dig-stud/week-03/week-03-getting-started-with-python.ipynb">in-class portion of Week 3</a> to help you.</p>

<p>To replicate best coding practices, you‚Äôre going to use alternating Markdown and Code cells in your Jupyter Notebook. In the first cell of the notebook, use your new Markdown skills to write your name and some sort of title (ex. ‚ÄúWeek 4 Homework‚Äù). Then each of the following steps should be preceded by a Markdown cell that documents in your own words what you‚Äôre doing in the following code cell (it doesn‚Äôt have to be super detailed). The code cell should contain the Python code that completes the task for that step.</p>

  <li>Use Lucy Parsons‚Äôs <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucy_Parsons">Wikipedia page</a> to assign variables about some of her biographical information:
    <ul>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">first_name</code></li>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">last_name</code></li>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">birth_year</code> - the year she was born</li>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">birth_state</code> - the state she was born in</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Make a new variable <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">full_name</code> and assign it a single string value using the variables <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">first_name</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">last_name</code>. End with a print statement that writes out a full sentence using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">full_name</code>.</li>
  <li>What is the state in which Parsons was born and how many letters (‚Äúcharacters‚Äù) are in the name of that state? Create a variable called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">birth_state</code> and then use a print statement to answer the question in a full sentence using that variable.</li>
  <li>How old was Lucy Parsons during the Haymarket affair? Calculate her age and assign it to a new variable <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">haymarket_age</code>. End with a full-sentence print statement answering the question that uses <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">haymarket_age</code>.</li>
  <li>Lucy Parsons‚Äôs contemporary and rival, Emma Goldman, also has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Goldman">a Wikipedia page</a>. Create variables that capture the number of footnotes for each of their Wikipedia pages. Then write a print statement that compares these two numbers in some way.</li>
