<p>Log into your Reclaim Hosting account click on cPanel. This is the overview page where you can manage a bunch of different aspects of your server account with Reclaim Hosting (such as URL domain names, setting up an email account based on your domain, etc.). Find <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">File Manager</code>and open this in a new browser tab, which will bring you to an interface showing you some folders. Much like your physical computer, your server space at Reclaim Hosting is organized into a collection of folders containing files, scripts, folders, etc. Don’t worry about what all of them mean. For now, navigate to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">public_html</code>. This is where you can add files, webpages, etc. that you want to be accessible by other people through an internet browser.</p>

<h2 id="make-a-sandbox-directory">Make a Sandbox Directory</h2>

<p>Your first step is to make a “sandbox” folder in your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">public_html</code> directory that is going to be your space to install and learn new tools. This is where you can mess around and try things out without worrying about anything breaking. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sandbox</code> folder is going to be set up so that it can be accessed in the following way: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">https://yourdomainnameurl/sandbox/</code>. When you start adding sub-folders or material within your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sandbox</code> folder they will be just be appended to that URL (ex. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">https://yourdomainnameurl/sandbox/photo-of-my-adorable-cat.jpg</code>).</p>

<p>To create your sandbox:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Make sure you are in File Manager (cPanel -&gt; File Manager)</li>
  <li>Navigate to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">public_html</code> folder and make sure you are inside the folder</li>
  <li>Add a new folder within your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">public_html</code> folder called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sandbox</code> (make sure it says <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">public_html</code> under “New folder will be created in:”)</li>
  <li>Navigate to the folder. It should be empty. :)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="add-a-file-to-your-sandbox">Add a file to your sandbox</h2>

<p>Now let’s try adding a file into your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sandbox</code> folder. While still in File Manager, click <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">+File</code> in the upper left, then name it <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hello.html</code>. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.html</code> ending tells File Manager what kind of file it is (in this case, an HTML webpage). Make sure it is created <em>inside</em> your sandbox folder, then click Create New File. You should see a new file inside your directory. Select it by clicking once, then click on HTML Editor towards the top of File Manager. Click the Edit button that appears in a pop-up, and you should be seeing a blank screen with some buttons at the top. Try writing a short message in the document, then click the Save button.</p>

<p>In a new browser tab, navigate to: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">https://yourdomainnameurl/sandbox/hello.html</code> and you should see your message. Congratulations!</p>

<p>If you get done with this step and your classmates are still working, go back to editing the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hello.html</code> file in the HTML Editor and try to make <strong>the ugliest webpage you possibly can</strong> (you can change the appearance of text using various buttons along the top row - ex. color, bold, etc.). Send your ugly webpage contestant to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#in-class</code> Slack channel.</p>

<p>&lt;—! a</p>

<h2 id="password-protect-your-sandbox-directory">Password Protect your Sandbox Directory</h2>

<p>Go back to cPanel under Reclaim Hosting (I recommend using a separate browser tab or using the one you left open). We are now going to add a password protection to your sandbox so that it is only viewable to people in this class (we’re all going to be using the same username and password). Open Directory Privacy (under Files section), then navigate to your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sandbox</code> folder within <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">public_html</code>. Once in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sandbox</code> folder, click Edit, then check the box for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Password protect this directory</code> and click Save. This will bring you to a new page, at which point you just go back one page and should see the option to type in a username and password. <strong>Fill in the username and password provided by Professor Blevins</strong>. This will be the same for all students so we can access each other’s work.</p>

<p>Have one of the members of your group try to open <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">https://yourdomainnameurl/sandbox/hello.html</code> and see if they can access it by using the same username and password. It should now be protected.</p>
