I"˛<p><em>Note: only for graduate students signed up for HIST 5260 or COMM 6710.</em></p>

<p>At the beginning of one class during the semester, you will present a short (5 minute) overview of a real-world digital project related to the week‚Äôs topic. You will provide a short introduction to the project along with how it (loosely) relates to the week‚Äôs theme or readings. You are welcome to discuss its background, strengths or shortcomings, etc. but keep in mind that you do not have very much time. Plan out ahead of time exactly what you need to convey to your classmates so that they can understand the project and its relationship to the theme for that day. Once classmates have had a chance to ask any questions about the project, you are going to end with <strong>an open-ended discussion question related to the project and the other readings/topic for that day</strong>.</p>

<p>The goal of this assignment is two-fold. First, it will provide the class with a series of real-world examples of particular method or topic ‚Äúin action.‚Äù Second, in trying to find your project you will get exposed to a wider body of digital studies research and production. I will have grad students select their class during Week 3 of the semester. Please email or Slack DM me with the specific project you are thinking of doing the week before class so that I can approve it.</p>

<p>In addition to your presentation, you will write a <strong>700-800 word post</strong> in your Wordpress sandbox that offers a formal written review of the project. Make sure your post includes screenshots or other visuals that illustrate your point. You should <strong>post a URL to the project &amp; your kickstarter discusison question</strong> to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#presentations</code> Slack channel prior to the start of class.</p>

<p><em>Submit the URL to your post <a href="https://ucdenver.instructure.com/courses/479412/assignments/1261959">on Canvas</a> at the beginning of whichever class you‚Äôve selected.</em></p>
