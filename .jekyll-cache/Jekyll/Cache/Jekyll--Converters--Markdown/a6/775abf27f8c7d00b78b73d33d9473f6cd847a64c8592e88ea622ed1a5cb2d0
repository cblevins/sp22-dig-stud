<p>Your goal is to create a short video using the above building blocks that includes the following:</p>

  <li>Choose two video segments recorded by your classmates to include in your promo</li>
  <li>Import the two video files, the image file, and audio file into your project.</li>
  <li>Add the image file to your Timeline and have it play for the first 6 seconds of your video.</li>
  <li>Add the audio file to the Timeline so that it plays during those opening 6 seconds and then stops (you‚Äôll want to trim it in the Timeline).</li>
  <li>Add three text objects so that they are overlaid onto the image during the opening 6 seconds of the video:
    <ul>

      <li>Professor Blevins - Spring 2023</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Add three of your classmates‚Äô videos to the Timeline so that they appear after the opening six seconds</li>
  <li>Trim several seconds from the beginning and/or end of at least one of your classmates‚Äô videos (ex. if there are several seconds of awkward silence at the beginning or end).</li>
  <li>End your video with 6 seconds of the image + overlaid course information again.</li>
  <li>Export your project content as a single new video file using the settings Format: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">H.264</code> and Match Source: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Medium Bitrate</code>. Make sure to rename the Output Name to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">yourfirstname-yourlastname-promo.mp4</code> and upload it to the #in-class Slack channel.</li>
</ul>
