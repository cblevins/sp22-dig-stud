### Introduction

Based on the interests and votes you expressed in Week 9, I've come up with several different hands-on "paths" you can take for the hands-on portion of class. I've divided these into different clusters.


### Mapping and QGIS

This is for people who are interested in more robust spatial analysis: making and working with spatial data and digitized historical maps, overlaying different kinds of geographical information, looking for spatial patterns, etc. QGIS is an open-source version of the widely used ArcGIS platform from ESRI software. Here are a series of three tutorials from historian Fred Gibbs geared specifically for history students:

1. ["Making a Map with QGIS"](http://fredgibbs.net/tutorials/qgis/making-a-map-with-qgis.html)
2. ["Linking and Styling Data with QGIS"](http://fredgibbs.net/tutorials/qgis/linking-and-styling-data-with-qgis.html)
3. ["Using Historic Maps with QGIS"](http://fredgibbs.net/tutorials/qgis/overlaying-historic-maps-with-qgis.html)
4. For ArcGIS online, there are a few relevant lessons: ["Create a Map"](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/get-started/quick-exercise-maps.htm), ["Explore spatial data"](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/get-started/quick-exercise-explore-data.htm), ["Solve a spatial problem"](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/get-started/quick-exercise-analysis.htm)

### Time- and Map-based Narratives

1. Hands-on tutorial on ArcGIS Story Maps with Bahare Sanaie-Movahed (in class on 11/6)
2. [Tutorial on making a timeline with Timeline.js]({{site.baseurl}}/week-10/timeline)
3. JMU Digital Communication Consulting, ["Introduction to StoryMap"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_hKGk6sn5E)
4. J. Kirby, [Neatline 101](https://publish.illinois.edu/commonsknowledge/2017/07/05/neatline-101-getting-started/) (Neatline is a plugin for Omeka that allows you to create map- and timeline-based narratives using an Omeka collection)

### Omeka

1. Miriam Posner and Megan Brett, ["Creating an Omeka Exhibit"](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/creating-an-omeka-exhibit), *Programming Historian* (2016)
2. The Albert M. Greenfield Digital Center for The History of Women’s Education ["Guide to Creating Omeka Exhibits"](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B5_baj3C7PmNZXk0cWs3WTM0am8/edit?pli=1)

### Tableau

1. [Series of training videos on Tableau](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/tableau-essential-training-2/) - especially no. 2, 3, 4, 9, and 12.

### Python

I've located several exercises and tutorials for Python that will help you with common tasks and skills:

1. Ethan Reed and Brandon Walsh, [Working with CSV files](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/humanitiesprogramming/humanitiesprogramming.github.io/blob/master/python/notebooks/working-with-csv.ipynb), *Introduction to Programming for Humanists*
2. William J. Turkel and Adam Crymble, [Downloading Webpages with Python](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/working-with-web-pages), *Programming Historian*
3. [Python and Library of Congress's *Chronicling America* database](https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/data-exploration/blob/master/ChronAm%20API%20Samples.ipynb)
4. [Data Exploration: Accessing Images from the Library of Congress](https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/data-exploration/blob/master/Accessing%20images%20for%20analysis.ipynb)

### Network Analysis

1. Marten Düring, [From Hermeneutics to Data to Networks: Data Extraction and Network Visualization of Historical Sources](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/creating-network-diagrams-from-historical-sources), *Programming Historian* - lighter-weight approach to networks using Palladio
2. John Ladd, Jessica Otis, Christopher N. Warren, and Scott Weingart, [Exploring and Analyzing Network Data with Python](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/exploring-and-analyzing-network-data-with-python), *Programming Historian* - more advanced network analysis using Python

### Topic Modeling

1. Miriam Posner, ["Messing around with the Topic Modeling Tool"](http://miriamposner.com/classes/dh201w19/tutorials-guides/text-analysis/messing-around-with-the-topic-modeling-tool/)
2. Miriam Posner & Andy Wallace, ["Very basic strategies for interpreting results from the Topic Modeling Tool"](https://miriamposner.com/blog/very-basic-strategies-for-interpreting-results-from-the-topic-modeling-tool/)
