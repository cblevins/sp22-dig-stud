## Making a Storymap

### Introduction

[StoryMap.js](https://storymap.knightlab.com) is made by the same group that built Timeline.js. Like the timeline tool, StoryMap.js a lightweight means of building web-based stories told through a map interface, with each step in the story pinned to a specific location. This works well for narratives that are strongly rooted in places. It doesn't allow a ton of customization but it has a comparatively shallow learning curve. In this exercise, you'll take the timeline of events in the history of feminism in the United States that you made last week and try to adopt it to a StoryMap interface. 

### Understanding StoryMap.js

First, explore the following example of a StoryMap: [Boston's Desegregation History](https://uploads.knightlab.com/storymapjs/36f523e62a023e72e26f89083055b128/desegregation-storymap-test/index.html). What kind of narrative is this StoryMap telling? Is it chronological? Thematic? Spatial? What sort of content does it include?

Second, explore the Northeastern University Library website [Beyond Busing: Boston School Desegregation Archival Resources](https://bpsdesegregation.library.northeastern.edu/). What are the differences between the website and the StoryMap?

Third, go back to the spreadsheet that you created last class about the history of feminism in the United States: <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mlY8Pe2M_Bc6nvoJEpNxi6plwu_Od0CvuqN-HxQtNPI/edit#gid=0>. How many of these events would work if they were told in a StoryMap format? How many wouldn't?

This is a fundamental distinction: not all historical narratives should necessarily be told using a map framework - just like not all historical narratives should be told with a timeline.

### Make your own StoryMap

Think back to our discussion last week about a theoretical digital collection of material related to graduate student life at Northeastern University in the 21st-century. We're going to continue this thought exercise by imagining how we might tell a historical narrative about this topic through a StoryMap. 

*As a group*, brainstorm a list of possible things you could include in this StoryMap (use the whiteboard to write the list down). Each of you will then choose a few of these items and use them to make some kind of narrative about graduate student life at Northeastern. Use the following tutorial and adapt it to make your own StoryMap: <http://teaching.erinbush.org/blog/2018/03/01/tutorial-creating-narrative-map-storymapjs/>. By the end of the exercise, you should have an initial StoryMap embedded on your website.
