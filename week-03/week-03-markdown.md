The goal of this lesson is to practice writing in Markdown. 

Go to: <https://jbt.github.io/markdown-editor/>. This is an online Markdown editor. To try it out, you're going to copy and paste your discussion questions for this week into the editor and then use Markdown to do the following:

1. Add a heading at the top that says "Week 3: Markdown"
2. Put your discussion questions into an ordered list
3. Make some words **bold** and some words *italics*
4. Insert a hyperlink to your Wordpress blog post that you made with your discussion questions.

Now log in to your Wordpress dashboard and edit the post that contains your discussion questions so that it looks like your Markdown version of the discussion questions.

Discussion: What are some of the differences between editing text in Wordpress vs. Markdown?
