As stated in the [Course Philosophy]({{site.baseurl}}/policies), I will not be using a traditional grading scheme to evaluate your work. Instead I have outlined a set of baseline expectations that you need to meet to succeed in this class. I will notify you during the semester if I feel you are not meeting one or more of these expectations.

### Baseline Expectations

- Carefully complete the assigned readings or tasks prior to the start of class 
- Attend each class on time and prepared to discuss that day's topics and readings. There are 29 classes in the semester and I don't expect or require perfect attendance. You do, however, need to be contributing to the classroom community, which is not going to be possible if you miss too many classes. If you need to miss class, please notify Professor Blevins (you don't need to give me a reason) and review the material or workshops to get caught up prior to the next class. 
- Actively participate in class activities and discussions. For discussions, this means making observations and asking questions that help the class think together. For hands-on workshops, this means making a good-faith effort to complete the activity and helping your peers to do so as well if they are struggling.
- Behave professionally and respectfully with each other. You can disagree and push each other to consider other perspectives, but bullying, intimidation, or discrimination will not be tolerated under any circumstances.
- Complete all assignments described below either by the required due date or within the window of dates for completion. 
- Take feedback from Professor Blevins and your classmates into account and make an effort to apply it to your assignments. I might ask you to revise and resubmit an assignment if I feel it is necessary.
- Complete self-assessments during the semester, including a final self-assessment that reflects on what you learned during the semester and the grade you feel you should receive, due May 12th by 11:59PM. I will distribute more detailed instructions for self-assessments.

In addition to readings, hands-on homework, and in-class discussions and activities, I have given you a series of more formal assignments to complete. If you feel that one of these assignments is not going to be useful for you, I am open to having you do an alternative assignment of comparable size. You need to request this in advance in an email to me, along with ideas for what you are interested in doing in its place (I am happy to help you brainstorm ideas). These assignments are as follows:
