title: Week 4 Homework
---

You're going to submit your first homework of the semester using a Jupyter Notebook. First create a new directory within your class folder called `homework` and then save a new Jupyter Notebook in that directory with the filename: `yourlastname-week-04-homework.ipynb`. Please use this naming convention for all of your homework submissions, as this will help me keep track of them.

You are going to write some Python code to generate information about the historical figure Lucy Parsons. In Step 1 you are going to manually enter information about Parsons as variables. In the rest of the steps you are going to *calculate* an answer using variables and operations, then print ou the results using the `print()` function. Refer back to the [in-class portion of Week 3]({{site.baseurl}}/week-03/week-03-getting-started-with-python.ipynb) to help you.

To replicate best coding practices, you're going to use alternating Markdown and Code cells in your Jupyter Notebook. In the first cell of the notebook, use your new Markdown skills to write your name and some sort of title (ex. "Week 4 Homework"). Then each of the following steps should be preceded by a Markdown cell that documents in your own words what you're doing in the following code cell (it doesn't have to be super detailed). The code cell should contain the Python code that completes the task for that step. 

1. Use Lucy Parsons's [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucy_Parsons) to assign variables about some of her biographical information:
  * `first_name`
  * `last_name`
  * `birth_year` - the year she was born
  * `birth_state` - the state she was born in
2. Make a new variable `full_name` and assign it a single string value using the variables `first_name` and `last_name`. End with a print statement that writes out a full sentence using `full_name`.
3. What is the state in which Parsons was born and how many letters ("characters") are in the name of that state? Create a variable called `birth_state` and then use a print statement to answer the question in a full sentence using that variable.
4. How old was Lucy Parsons during the Haymarket affair? Calculate her age and assign it to a new variable `haymarket_age`. End with a full-sentence print statement answering the question that uses `haymarket_age`.
5. Lucy Parsons's contemporary and rival, Emma Goldman, also has [a Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Goldman). Create variables that capture the number of footnotes for each of their Wikipedia pages. Then write a print statement that compares these two numbers in some way.

**Remember** to name your Jupyter Notebook with the convention described above and then upload it to: <https://www.dropbox.com/request/6DlmzXwe51JsbvFrlQ4c>.
