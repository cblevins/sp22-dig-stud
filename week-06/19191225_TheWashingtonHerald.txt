Three Film Hits Offered
With Advent of New Week
- By KAJtLB DORSEY.
The dawninjr of this particular glad Tuletide morning brings to
Washington, in the form of Christmas gifts at large, at least thrfte
new cinema productions of onusual distinction. It is. of course, unfor
tunate. that three more dajrs must elapse before Washington will real
ise on these pieces, but we are promised three hits at any rate.
Moore's Strand Theater offer*, among other shows of the coming
ereek. a photoplay Vhich will be of unusual interest to Washingtonians
by reason of its localisation in the District q# Columbia. It is the
Augustus Thomas cinema production entitled "The Capitol,** which,
in the main, depicts the struggle of a Representative with an un
scrupulous band of food profiteera
As Mr. Moore's press agent asserts so aptly: "We are accustomed
t* witnessing fights staged on the brink of deep canyons in the Rockies
and dangerous feats performed in this and that gorge among great
mountains, but when such fights occur right on the Palisades of the
Potomac above Georgetown, and when the heroine of the story goes
over Great Falls In a rowboat." we realize that here's a photoplay that's
getting close to home. There are. of course, other productions offered
by other Moore houses, but we select "The Capitol" for its particularly
close-to-home settlnga
The two Loew houses offer a pair of selections that are
memorable not only as photoplays of distinction, but for their
associations, both past and present. The Palace announces "Haw
thorne of Ae U. & A.", as the predominant atyeen feature of
that theater's program for the full week that begins next Sunday.
The very name of "Hawthorne of the U. S. A." arouses memories of
Douglas Fairbanks, in those days when tho irrepressible "Doug"
was Just an ordinary, every-day. featured actor of the stage, and in
the days when the cinema was little more than a side show curiosity.
The attraction, however, has been lifted from its stage form and made
into a photoplay and Instead of Fairbanks, wo have that other bril
liant and handsome young star, Wallace Held. pictured in Jhe stellar
role, supported by Lila "Lee. a cast of unusual distinction, even for
the screen.
Those who read their theatrical guides with care will., probably
be aware of the tremendous sensati^p that Dorothy Dalton is causing
in "Aphrodite,*" the great stage spectacle that is now truly the talk
^?f New York. Miss Dalton forsook the films, temporarily, to appear in
this big audible masterpiece, but before she left, she made a picture
named "His .Wife's Friend" and that is the production that Ix>ew*s
Columbia offers as its chief feature for the first four days of next week.
Mr. Crandall's publicity forcea have been greatly elated and ex
ceedingly enthusiastic over the foreshadowed presentation of Reginald
Barker's carefully made and really pretentious offering. "The Flame
of the Dcs<?rL" Mr. Barker's production, of course, will not be ready
for showing until next Sunday, but the mero fact that it offers the
Illustrious Geraldine Farrar in the leading role, eupportcd by her
illustrious husband. Ix>u Teliegen. is a very strong earnest of Its value.
Th? legitimate theaters of the city are engaged, for the balance
of the week in playing out those programs which began a week's run
last Monday night. At the Garrick. Gregory Kelly Is holding forth lti
P. G. Wodehouse's "Piccadilly Jim"?a play that ofTers fair enough
entertainment, but one which rather disappointed the critics, who ex
pected a vast deal of fine stiflt from tho combination of Wodehouse
and Guy Bolton. The Garrick is busily preparing, however, for I^ewls
Selznick's first venture into production for the audiblo stage which
begins a week's engagement there next Sunday night \inder jlhe title of
"Bucking the Tiger." More will be said of it next Sunday.
At the Belaseo, Miss Cowl seems to have a fairly meritorious piece
In "Smilin' Through." the piece which opened a pre-Manhattan engage
ment last Monday night, but the Bclasco will hurl drama to the winds
next Sunday evening and blossom forth in a new Hammerstein musn-al
show called "Joan of Arkansaw."
Harry Fox's new musical vehicle. "Zip Goes a Million." I>y Guy
Bolton. Budd de Sylva and Jerome Kern, is bowling them over with
some of its stuff at Poll's this week. It is jammed with good music
and It's funny. As soon as |Jr. Fox finishes his vocal efforts, in will
roll "Sometime" for another Washington engagement, this time with
Frank Tinney in the leading role. Kd Wynn lent his drollery to
?"Sometime." which had a premiere hero some time ago. and this time
Dr. Tlnn^y will endeavor to show us his wares for the first time siuce
he blossomed forth in "Atta Boy."
At the National. "The Better *Olc" will hole out next Saturday
night in favor of George M. Cohan's "A Trince There Was." Grant:
f Mitchell has laid aside "The Tallor-Made Man" and stepped into the;
chief role that Cphan was so historically called upon to fill some
months ago. %

Die rmlt of the chat follows:
By (jlEORtiE MORELAMD.
There was a very interesting game
of baseball played last cummer at the
Actors' Colony at 8t James, Long
m Island, between the old-time actors
^ and the younger players. /"
The old-timers consisted of Ted
Burns, lb.; Tom !<ewi*. 2b.; VJonel
Bsrrymore. 3b.; Willie Collier, pitcher;
Ben Wilson, c.; John Collier, s. s..
and Messrs. Bert I^slie. Charley Rig
low and Bob Daly In the outfield
Ted Burns, who played first base in
this game, has had his troubles evei
since the game was played. Both
sides say they are light, so one must
be wrong. He called upon all the
leading, baseball authorities in the
country, but ss yet has not had a
satisfactory answer to his argument.
You see. it was to be a friendly
game, as all games between actor*
are supposed to be. All went well
until the second Inning, when a dis
pute came up over a play that caused
both sides to talk so much that II was
dark before the argument was settled
and It has been dark many a time
aince, for the two sides are still at It.
De Wolf Hopper, the comedian, was
umpiring and his faithful guardian
was a daschund that follows De Every

him position behind the bat. his guard
was there. The ft-st man up for the
young actors hit a double to left field. ?
Ho was safely perched on that bag
when the pitcher made a wild plteh.
Tbe ball did not get away from the
*calcher. who made a great Jump and
knocked down the balL But that Is

A beautiful star In a beautiful set
ting is Bessie Barriscale in "Beckon
ing Roads." her latest production,
which begins a three-day run at
Loew'a Columbia today. In its lavlsh
ness of settings and gorgeous cos
tuming. the popular siar*??latest ve
hicle ranks as one of the most beau
tiful of the year.
The most tmmptunus set is the cafe
scene, in which Miss Barriscale as
Marqulta Shay meets the mysterious
Raron Brinker, Wall Strict shark and
gambler, to whom later she is to
prove an avenging Nemesis for the
death of her guardian, a victim of
the Baron's schemes.
Miss Barriscale Is Introduced In the
scene on the broad staircase, gowned
in a dress of lllmy texture and- Irides
cent colors, wearing a wrap of gold
''loth sparkling with sequlms and
trimmed with monkey fur. Fifty j
beautiful girls dres* the scene, ar-j
rayed in gorgeous gowns and wraps
of Mtriking mode.
The production is a veritable
fashion-show that will give the
feminine fans a thrill. It is. without
doubt, the most elaborately stated
ami frowned spectacle In which the
beautiful Ilessie Rarriscale has ever
appeared.
You know how it makes you puff
for someone to tell you that you re-'
semble Wallie Reid or Mary Pick-!
ford or some other movie celeb.;
Darken then, to the tale of Edward
Everett llorton. who plays stazc leads
In T^os Angeles.
"First they tell me that I look like
Rlliott Dealer on the stage and then
when 1 wore a mustache in a play,
someone asked me if I was Lew Cody.
"One day 1 was walking down
Bradway and a man came up and
said. "Why. if it isn't Tom Meigtian!** j
"Of course. I'm llattered-and all that. ?
but why doesn't someone kindly tell
tnc that I look like Lddie 1 lor ton?"'
Douglas Fairbanks is now a. full-j
fledged member of the Klks. He was
initiated by thirty brawny members
of the Santa Monica Lodge. "Were;
they brawny?" Doug was a.*ked.
"Oh. dear! Oh. dear"' said the screcu
star with his inimitable smile.

A STAGE CHR
Like a Chrlstmaa story from O. i
Henry are the Incident* lurroundlnl
the winning? by Rachael Barton, of the
1600 offered by Oliver Morocco for the
beet play submitted to him by a mem
ber of Prof. Baker's Harvard class tn
play writ in*.
Some two weeks ago Morosco. who
was #ne of thf Judges |D the contest,
read the winning script, "Mama's Af
fairs" and liked It so much that he
called In Joseph Eehowich. his Bos
ton attorney, and askfd him to skim
an eye over It. fte. tpo. liked it, re
gardless of whether or net it won the
prize. Accordingly, the picking of a
cast was begun and within a short
time, "llama's Affairs" began to take
shape on the stage of the Morosco
Theater.
About a week later, however, an
other script came In with the name1
of John Elliott as the author and
bearing the monoeyllsblc title of
"Mom." This. too. struck the fsncy
of Morosco. impressing him so much
that he wished he had not started
rehearsing the other. Contracts had
been signed with Elfle Shannon, Ame
lia Bingham snd others, however, so
cliat he could hirdly back down. and.
In the end he decided that he would
do both of them.
By this time the day for the end
ing of (lie contest was drawing near
and Prof. Baker came down from
Harvard and with Wlnthrop Ames.
"Mama's Affairs" was adjudged tlie
best of the forty-two scripts sub
mitted. It was. therefore, entitled
to the prize.
"I think ?Mom* *? the better play,
even though you don't agree with
me." said Morosco to the two others
after the matter had been settled.
-Well, the author of "Mom" won't
be disappointed, anyway." replied
Baker, "for John Elliott and Jtach
h**i Barton Butler arc one and the
same person. Both the plays you
have accepted were written by Mies
Barton.**
After the surprise of this had
subsided. Morosco asked Eebowlch
to look mp feherc his latest author
lived, for Professor Baker thought
.she resided somewhere in New Eng
land. Not so. however, for the at
torney soon discovered her to be
living at the Hotel Remington, and
in five minutes was en his way to
the hotel. Meeting h*r he told her
that Morosco wished to see her the
following day. and at the appoint
ed time she was introduced to the
manager.
"1 called you over. Miss Butler,
to tell you that your play "Ma
ma's Affairs" has w.on the prize 1
offered." said Morosco.
Miss Butler could hardly reply at
first, hut finally did so, and Morov
co added:
"And to also tell you that I have
accepted your other play. "Mon\"
written under the name of John El
liott."
"Oh," was all she could say.
"And now, if you wish. 1 shall be
glad to take you downstairs and let
you see the prize winner !u rehear
sal."
Tears, the pre-rogatlve of every
woman, then asserted themselves
and. after thoy had passed, the new
est prize winner murmured.
"Just to think that I was going
hungry in that hotel while a play of
mine was in rehearsal within two
blocks of me."
Mis? Butler was then taken to the
ofP.ce of Mr l^ehowlch where con
tracts for the two pla>s were drawn
and handed to her. together with a
check for 5L000, upon receipt of which

To the Man Who Wears Socks.
With the rising of today's sun, you are the most pitiable object
ri God's green footstool, and for the entire day you are an outcast,
_e man without a country. So near to the sovereignty of the
Christ-like spirit that parades today, yet removed by eternal dis
tances in your cynical sophistication, for you are the man who has
outgrown stockings, the man who glories in the grown-up privilege
? of socks.
We have noticed you many times it? the past week. Wc have
heard your oft-repcated worldly wise logic that brands Christmas
as a nuisance. Wc have listened to without retaining your plausible
reasoning against Christmas gifts, as you quoted incident upon incident
that showed tfie wastefulness, the "you give me and I'll give you"
attitude; the jokes of paragraphers and near humorists anent Christ
mas jewelry, lurid neckties, atrocious cigars, multiple house slippers
and all the standard laughs that are received each twelvemonth at
this time. _
Your boisterous unasked philosophy has found many listeners who
have thought it sound. You have been dubbed a sensible man rather
than a sentimental one and you have accepted gracefully that hom
age as you pictured yourself an oasis in the desert of human
ignorance. Smug and content, you sit your throne of wisdom and
smile tolerantly, perhaps, at the wearied shoppers, the evergreens,
the stereotyped "Merry Christmas." and hold yourself aloof, superior
because to you Christmas is buf the 25th of December.
But if you could but open your eyes and'see clearly your oasis
would fade into a mirage, your armor of sophistication into a pitiful
shell of papier-mache, your wisdom a hollow sounding bubble of
imbecile soliloquy.
For the wisdom of your mighty, mature master mind is as soft
' as putty before human contact. It lacks the vital alloy that would
make it colossal. It has not been tempered by the refining touch
from the heart.
? And on this day you must pay. The weeks of your autocratic
reign are over. The subjects to your dominant logic have fled to
listen to him who breathes the Christmas spirit. You are the more
woeful because you cannot understand your forced abdication. And
you never will understand while you wear the socks of muturity.
* But the spirit of Christmas will go on without you. It is too
closely linked with that feeling that weaves a halo around the
memory of mother and home; it is blessed by heaven itself in its
holiness, and fraudulent as may be some of its ramifications, basically
2 it is~as sound and genuine as the ages, and it will never die.
So prate on in your worldlincss, scatter your superior wisdom,
mock the childish faith in Santa Claus and pity us in our ignorance,
but to us the glowing baby faces, the angel light in childish eyes
and the music of childish voices as stockings are emptied on Christ
mas morning is the most God-like sympathy on earth.
And the day that you forswore stockings for the mannish socks
' TQu now wear was the saddest day in your whole life.
Reward Service.
The Sterling-Lehlbach pension bill for government employes is
a step in the right direction. It is to be hoped that Congress will
14 make it one of the first measures to be acted upon following the
; Christmas holidays.
The statement that 6,400 employes will be retired as soon as
'the bill is passed and that only 20 per cent of this number will
J- have to be replaced, is a most powerful argument for the need of
such legislation.
A serious question arises, however, as to the fairness of the
Sterling-Lehlbach measure to government employes as a whole. The
bill provides for the retirement of those over 65 years of age at a
maximum annuity of $720, and employes, disabled in service, may
be retired in like manner if. they have been in the government
employ at least fifteen years previous to disability. Just why the
advanced, age of an employe should govern his retirement is not
satisfactorily explained, unless it is that with age comes inefficiency.
This being granted, it would be more just and fairer to all
government civil servants to reward long and faithful service rather
than advanced age. Surely a quarter of a century of service should
entitle employes to retirement such as that proposed for employes
who have rcached the age of 65. The latter may only have been
in the service of the government for ten or fifteen years. Would
it not be better to fix a maximum of 40 years ior entry in the
employ of the government with the privilege of retirement at the
age of 65? Entrants beyond the age of 40 might have to
forego the pension right, or acccpt a modified jato of pension.
Provision could be made to retire all employes Ihcn at the, age
of 65 when the legislation bccamc cfTcctive.
Indeed, would it not be fairer all around to make retirement
optional after a quarter of a ccntury of faithful scrviec?
Again, it would seem fairer to government employes disabled
in scrvice to make the pension immediately effective at the time of
disability. Their injury and suitable reward should not be judged
by the number of years put in with the government previous to
their disability. Their reward should be operative at once if through
injury or disease their physical condition denies their giving 100
per fent service. '
; Retirement of army and navy officers at 62 and 64 years cannot
be used as an argument in considering a pension- for civil employes.
The major number in the military scrvite enter their profession as
young men. Their service is life-long. While this is true in many
cases in the civil service, it is by no means the general rult
The civil employe, therefore, should be rewarded for lofig and
'^faithful service, just as is the military employe.

The peg on which this atory la

"L'ltallana In Algerl," the old opera
bouffe of Rossini which the Metro
politan has Just revived. The woes
and wastrels of the Italian girl have
not been sung here since the days
of President Jackson.
What Is most remarkable about
Pogany Is that he has had only
three weeks' study In art schools.
And yet the famous How Shoe
Bend, aglltter with the Jewels of
art connoisseurs, fairly gasped when
the curtain went up revealing th*
interior of a small harem room, the
walls of which wers worked with

CHAPTER 44.
1 Joseph'* policy -to stay his brethren. 14
JudJLh's humble suppuration to Jom*i4i.
And he commanded the steward
of bin house, paying. Fill the men's
sacks with food, as much as they
can carry, and put every man's
money in his sack's mouth.
2 And put my cup, the silver cup,
in the sack's mouth of the youngest,
and his corn money. And he did
according to the word that Joscpn
had spoken.
3 As toon as the morning was
light, the men were sent away, they
and their asses.
4 And when Ihey were gone out
of the city, and not yet far off,
Joseph said unto his steward. Up.
follow after the men; and when thou
dost overtake them, say unto therh.
Wherefore have ye rewarded evil
for good ? /
5 Is not this It in which my lord
drinketh and whereby indeed he
divineth? ye have done evil in so
doing. ?
6 II And he overtook them, and
he spake unto them these same
words.
7 And they said unto him. Where
fore saith my lord these wd^ds? God
forbid that thy servants should ao
according to this thing:
8 Behold, the money, which we
found in our sacks' mouths, we
brought again unto thee out of the
land of Canaan: how then should
we steal out of thy lord's houso
silver or gold?
9 'With whomsoever of th>?
servants it be found, both let nm.
die. and we al*o will be my lord's
bondmen
10 And he said. Now also let It
be according unto your words: he
with whom It is found shall be my
servant: and ye shall be blameless.
11 Then they speedily took down
evsry man his sack to the ground,
and opened every man his tack.
IS And he searched, and begsn
at the eldest, and left at the young
est: snd the'eup was foun$ In Ben
Jamln's sack.
13 Then they rent their clothes,
and lsded every man his ass, ahd re
turned to the city. v.
14 H And Judah and hl^brethren
came to Joseph's house; for he was
yet there: and they fell before him
on the ground.
15 And Joseph\ said unto them.
What deed Is'this that ye have done?
wot ye not that such a man as I
can certainly divine?
16 And Judah .said.* What shall
we say unto my Tord? what shall
we speak? or how shall we clear
oursejves? God hath found out the
iniquity of thy servants: behold, We
are my lord's servants, both we.
and he also with whom the Cup is
17 And he said. Hod forbid that
should do so: hut the man in
whose hand the cup is found, he
shall he my servant;, and as i???
you. pet you up in peace unto your
father.
IS 11 Then Judah came near unto
him. and said, O my lord, let t#ny
servant. 1 pray thee, speak a word
in my lord's ears, and let not thine
anger burn against thy servant: loi
thou art even as Pharaoh.
19 My lord asked his servants,
saving. Have ye a father, or a
brother?
?JO And we said unt6 my lord.
We have a father, an old mnn. and
a child of his old age, a little one;
and his brother is dead, and he
alone is left of his mother, and his
father loveth him.
21 And thou saidst unto thy
servants. Bring him down unto me,
[that I may set mine eyes upon him.
22 And we said unto my lord,
I The lad cannot leave his father: for
if he should leave his father, his
I father would die.
23 And thou saidst unto thsc
I servants, " Except your youngest
i brother come down with you. y?*
shall nee my face no more.
24 And it came to pass when we
came up unto thy servant my ratnw..
we to\d him the words of my lord.
25 And our father said. GO again,
and buy u? a little food. I
26 And we said. We cannot go
down: if our youngest brother be
iwith us then we will go down: for
! we may not see the man's face, ex
cept our youngest brother be with
us.
27 And thy servant my father
said unto us. Ye know that my wife
bare me two sons:
28 And the one went out from
me, and 1 said. Surely he is torn in
pieces; and I saw him not since:
29 And If ye take this also rrom
me. and mischief befall him. yt
shall bring down my gray hairs
with sorrow to the grave.
SO Now therefore when I come
to thy servant tny father, and the
lad be not with us; seeing that his
life is bound up in the lad's life;
31 Tt Shall come to pass,v when he
seeth that the lad is not with us.
that he will die: and thy servants
shall brtng down the gray hairs of
thy servant our father with sorrow
to the grave.
32 For thy servant became
surety .for the lad unto my father,
saying. If I bring h\jn not unto
thee, then I shall bear the blame
to my father for evfcr.
33 Now therefore, I pray thee, let
I thy servant ahjfe instead of the l v'
| a bondman to my lord; and let IN
| lad go up with his brethren.
34 For how-shall I go up to ir.\

civilization?. Meanwhile the Panama
Railroad had been built by Americans
over a half century ago, with appal
ling loss of life, so that it is said, of
course with exaggeration, that every
sleeper laid represented the death of a
man. Then the French canal com
pany started work, and for two or
three years did a good deal, until it
became evident that the task far ex
ceeded its powers; and then to mis
calculation and inefficiency was added
the hideous greed of adventurers, try
ing each to save something from the
general wreck, and the company
cloned with infamy and ecandal.
vSow we have taken hold of the Job.
We have difficulties with our own peo
ple. of course. I%haven't a doubt that
it will take a little longer and cost
a little more than men now appreciate,
but I believe that the work is being
done with a very high degree both of
efficiency and honesty; and I am im
mensely struck by the character of
American employes who are engaged,
not merely in superintending the work,
but in doing all the jobs that need
skill and intelligence. The steam
shovels, the dirt trains, the machine
shops, and the like, are all filled with
American engineers, conductors, ma
chinists. boilermaker*. carpenter*.
From the top to the bottom these
men are so handy, so efficient, so
energetic, that it is a real pleasure to
look at them. Stevens, the head engi
neer, is a big fellow, man of daring
and good sense and burly power. All
of these men are quite as formidable
and would, if it were necessary, do
quite as much in battle as the crews
of Drake and Morgan: but as it is,
they are doing a work of infinitely
more lasting consequence. Nothing
whatever remains to show what Drake
and Morgan did. They produced no
real effect down here, but Stevens
and his men are changing the face
of the continent, are doing the great
est engineering feat of the ages, and
the effect of their work will be felt
while our civilization lasts. I went
over everything that I could possibly
go over in the time at my disposal.
I examined the quarters of married
and single men, white men and ne
crocs. I went over the ground of the
Gatun and I<a Boca dams: went
through Panama and Colon, an 1 spent
a day in the Culebra cut, where the
great work is being done. There the
huge steam shovels are hard at it;
scooping huge mases of rock and
gravel and dirt previously loos* ned by
the drillers and dynamite blasters,
loading It on trains which take it
away to some dump, either in the
Jungle or where the dams are to built.
They are eating steavdily into the
mountain, cutting it down and down,
little tracks are laid on the side hills,
rocks blasted out. and the great
ninety-five-ton steam shovels work up
like mountain howitzers until they
come to where they can with -ad
vantage begin their work of eating In
to and destroying the raouutainside.
With intense energy men. and
machines do their task, the white men
supervising matters and handling th?
machines, while the tens of thousand#
of black men do the rough manuaJ
labor where it is not worth while to
have machines do it. It is an epic
feat, and one of immense significance.
The deluge of rain meant that many
,of the villages were kneedeep in water,
while the flooded rivers tore throng*
the tropic forests. It Is a real tropic
forest, palms- and bananas, bread
fruit trees, bamboos, lofty retHn*. an?|
gorgeous butterflies and brilliant
colored birds fluttedhg among the or
chids. There are beautiful flowers,
too.
All my old enthusiasm for natural
history seemed to revive, and I would
have given a good deal to have stayed
and tried to collect specimens. II
would be a good hunting country, too;
deer, and now and then jaguars and
tapir, and great birds that they cal
wild turkeys: there afe alligators In
the rivers. One of the trained nurses
from a hospital wen^ to bathe in a
pool last August and an alligator
grabbed him- by the legs and wai
making off with him. but was for
tunately scared away, leaving th?
man hadly injured.
I tramped everywhere through th?
?Ajd. Mother did not do the roughest
work, and had tjme to see more of the
really plctureeque and beautiful side
of the life, and really enjoyed herself.
P. 8. The Oatun dam will make s
lake miles long, and the railroad now
goes on what will be the bottom of
this lake, and it was curious ^o think
that in * few years great ships would
be floating In water 100 feet above
; where we were.

; rest, and through an Interstice in this
I he detected what seemed to be a
damp wooden beam. At this point he
brought bis Iron bar into play.
It was not long before he discovered
that his work was cut out for him.
The cement was like flint and his
blunt makeshift implement wee almost
useless against It. Ankle-deep in the
muddy water, be patiently pecked #nd
pounded and chipped, endeavoring ?jc
| enlarge the crevice so as to use
, bar as a lever. The sweat streamed
' from him and he became dismsyed et j
I his own weakness. He wan forced to*
rest" frequently.
Rosa bung over the orifice above,
encouraging him. inquiring eagerly as
to his progress. During his frequent
breathing spells he could discern her
white fsce dimly illumined by the
candlelight from below.
After he had worked for an hour or
two. he made a report: "It begins to
! look as if there really was a bulk
head or a door in there.**
The girl clapped her hands and
laughed with delight. "Do hurry,
dear: I'm dying of suspense **
O'Reilly groaned: "TTiat fellow. Se
bastian. knew his business. This
cement is like steel, and I'm afra.d
of breaking my crowbar."
Rost found a leaf, folded a kiss into
i It. and dropped it to him. "Thst will
give you strength." she declared.
O'Reilly lost all count of time sft??r
while and he was incredulous wh?>n
I Jacket came to warn him that day
light was less than an hour sway.
"Why. I haven't started!" he pro
I tested. He discovered, much to his
i surprise, that he was ready to drop
from fatigue and that his hands w4r??
?torn and blistered; when he hud
! climbed the nfce to the upper air he
fell exhausted Wn the deep grass. "I?
I I'm not myself at all." he apologized^d
! "nothing to eat. you know. But th^
1m work will go faster now. for I've mad a (
| a beginning." |

jMarket Very Quiet in Spite
Of Call Money Rate
Fixed at 15 Per Cent.
Uj MROADAK WALL.
New York. Dec. M.-In ?plte of a
call money rmte of U per cent, stock*
?were strong. today, although very
quiet. Those few that were active
^distinguished themselves with rather
aharp advances, except Brooklyn
- iptd Transit, which went feverishly
a new low record for all time at 1L
Dividends - of market Importance
4 were announced were 4 per cent
American lee common and an in
ase of California Packing dividend
a I per cent basis. The moat active
jatocka were American Tobacco Secur
Itlea. Endlcott Johnson. American
_T hisnnil Keystone. California Pack
ing and Pere Marquette. The last
named made a new high record.
The Tobacco stocks were favorites
~<tor two reasons. In the first place,
they have been acting well ever since
the panic of November 12 and It had
-fceen evident that Insiders were ac
.cumulating them. The total absence
ef any news on these Issues Is mysti
fying the Street and leads traders to
'ielleve that something very Important
pi brewing. In the second place, the
saying of Tobacco by the people over
the holiday season is what might be
'called absolutely reckless. This Is the'
first Christmas without whisky and
the tobacco dealers are getting the
benefit. The tobacco and candy stores
were unable to handle all the trade.
r^Earnings therefore of the tobacco and
"^eandy companies for December are
^certain to establish new high records,
i American Linseed rose S1-2 points
3on rumors of remarkably good earn
Cga. which are undoubtedly true.
Keystone Tire was sold rather i
eely. Sugar stocks were dull, for,
?Wsil Street has decided to let them
itelone.
II Endlcott Johnson Is understood to
?ke selling at the rate of 12.000.000 a
gweek gross, and judging from the
krtce of shoes in retail stores this
Xnust mean at least $1,000,000 a week
Vet profit, or JS2.000.000 a year. The
Sdrance of r a share, therefore. In
stock attracted but little atten
in Wall Street for Wall Street
Aeeed how the pool could be so
^conservative as to advance it only
at mucli.

ALLIED DEBTS
RAISE PROBLEM
?????? ?
Liquidation by Means of
Scrip Discussed by
Holland.
The governors of the Federal Re
serve Board, at Washington, who
have never been accused of inspiring
any kind of politics and who during
the whole course of the war were
faithful to the obligations which un
der the law were upon them, have
I intimated, ?specially through some
I recent statements by Governor Hard
1 lng. that they are convinced that
no other method of paying or llqul
! dating the enormous trade balance
, which other nations will owe the
United States on account of pur
I chases made In 1919 than by one of
I three methods: ?
First, our debtors ^ might send gold
' to us and probably would if they j
possessed* any. Kven in England, ac- ,
i cording to the recent bank statement. ,
I the gold reserve held by the Bank .
of England against a very large is
sue of paper 1* not much over IS j
! !>er cent. Our laws require the Fed- j
, era! Reserve Bank to keep on hand.
It reserve of 40 i>er cent In gold j
against the issue of currency, and (
I apparently trie brinks are Just about i
! at the limit which the law permits.!
i Therefore cold aettlements are out
;of the question. Another way *fould I
be the sending of commodities to!
I the United States by the other na- j
Itlons. Already a considerable In- |
' crease In our Imports of our foreign- ;
made commodities was observed in I
the latter part of this year, but it
was almost trivial in comparison:
with the volume of our exports^ >
There remains, therefore, a third
'method, and that is the extension j
! of credits. This appears to be the
, only available method. If. In fact, it <
be available. The Niblest bankers. ?
and apparently the Federal Reserve ;
Board, are of the opinion that it j
can be mnde available, although to .
do that will entail the co-operation j
of the ablest in I nils in the govern
ment and of the shiest men or j
, finance an.l Industrial lon.lerfhlp
The Secretary of the Treasury Mr.
Glass has intimated that the ?***'?
j sion of credits should he the work
of Individuals and banks. Not too
creat a burden he says should
t placed upon the banks. Those ?
! Kre conspicuous In Industry and com
I merce should cooperate in extending
I credits, nut it IS difficult to see how
j the banks could crently facilitate the
: extension of credits. There misht
i come a serious situation for the banks
I due to the depreciation in the market
| value of railroad securities and the
j dumpln; of foreiKn securities upon
? the American market.
I If therefore some method can t?
I perfected which would ?rta l h?
competition between the 1 nited
! States and - the strongest nylons
! across the sea. especially Great
Britain and France, then there might
be issued, strengthened by the K^ar
antee of these nations, something,
which for convenience is called scrip
or debentures or which might be culled
bv any other appropriate name^ It
would be necessary In addition to the
scrip thus Issued that have the legal
tender quality, although that would
apply exclusively to the use of scrip
in settling International tra<fvu

creation of a hat lor wear at mati*

tively enough, with brown velvet
crown, rounding and rather high. But
the brim, upturned throughout Its ex

hold them to the crown.

Boy Slayer of Two, Broods Over Boyhood
Christmas Spent at Side of His Mother
John McHenry to Find;
Stocking Pinned to Cell;
Door This Morning. |
Tells Reporter of Last
Yuletide He Spent With
Mother and of Air Rifle
She Gave Him.
B7 RILLA ElfGLE.
With the grim specter of a pal
lows across his Christmas sky John
McHenry, 19-year-old slayer of Wal
lace W. MuJcare and Detective
James E. Armstrong on January 14
last, will awaken this morning to
lind tied to the bars of his cell in
murderers' row at the District Jail
a Christipas stocking bulging with
fruit and candies.
Superintendent Charles J. Foster
has prepared a similar surprise for
the some 200 prisoners at that insti
tution.
It will be the first bit of Christ
mas "Johnny" has known since the
deatli of his mother, six years ago
in St. Louis, when he was a lad
of 13 and before* he had begun the
course In crime that brought him
to his present plight.
ReenllM Christmas With Mother.
The last Christmas with his mother
the youthful killer remembers vividly.
He still glows with pleas Ore at the
memory of the long coveted air rifle
he found at the foot of his Christmas |
tree that morning, the gift of his j
mother, who, by many sacrifices, had J
been able to purchase the desired toy j
for her son. "Johnny" was a crack I
shot and his mother had frequently |
heard him express a wish to own the J
very gun that lay smooth and shining |
in its long box when he awakened ;
that Christmas morning.
Later, this proficiency with fire
arms was to play no small part in the
f rowning tragedy of "Johnny's" life,
for Wallace Mulcare, the tirst of the
boy bandit's victims, fell at his first
shot and each of the bullets tired at
Detective Armstrong during the head
quarter* detective's struggle to cap
tore him. took effect, resulting in
Armstrong's death. .
Asked what he had done with his
first gun, McHenry said:
*'Oh, I used to pick off a few spar
rows just to rtSake the other kids' eyes
grow big,? and then added proudly.
"None of 'em could shoot the way I
could." ?
Other Yuletldes Damned.
This prized flrst gun has dimmed
in the young prisoner's iriTnd the
memory of^ other Christmases, when
he received "kid" toys such as base
balls, gloves and footballs.
As a very tiny youngster he remem
bers peeking over the railing to catch
a glimpse of Santa Claus and the
great disappointment of learning that
the good saint of all children was a j
myth still lingers as he talks of his j
"kid" days.
Frail and slight. McHenry appears ]
to be a "kid" still but his eyes and
bearing tell of a knowledge and ex
perience beyond his years. Detec-'
tives who have questioned him believe
he must have been trained in crime
by experts in the game?and that he
learned his lessons quickly and well.
McHenry, himself, admits that after
his mother's death, he drifted to De
troit and there became a member of
a gang of auto thieves and an expert
1^ changing the appearance of a
stolen car. Later he became the
driver of a wholesale bootlegger's car
and frequently, he says, was under
fire while on his unlawful business.
The knowledge that he was engaged
In a practice that would sooner or |
later bryig him into conflict with the I
law did not seem to bother him even
trom the start.
'It was an eiu?y way to earn
money/* he declare*, "and all the
other fellows were doing it."
As lie wan graduated . from one
crime school to another, each of his
associates seems to have taught him
some trick of his trade, auto thieves,
bootlegcers and criminals of every
description figuring In the story that
has been drawn from him bit by bit.
Young as he is. he evidently has
been thoroughly grounded in the first j
principle of the criminal code?always ,
preserve a ''front" In the face of the
law. Surly and silent since the1
night of his capture, the. first reali
zation of the plight to which his |
life had brought him was in his
thoughtful remark as he entered his
cell Christmas Eve Ortt 'he wouldn't
like to nee any other kid in a fix
like that."
"Bad company." he said sagely
from the depths -of his short ex-,
perience, "is the easiest way to get
into trouble, especially if a kid hasn't
ahy money or home. If a fellow
happens to be bright Or quick there's
always plenty of people to tip him |
off to any easy way to make money
and more than he had ever heard
of before."

drive before Congress for these thin**,
end It le declared by people In cloee
touch wlQi the situation that any
action taken with regard to the school
problem which would tend to af -
gTavate rather than help matters I'
ill-advised at this time.
With' ^business men and citizens
working as one with the school of
ficials to develop the important
phases of the service, it is very
much feared that when the Federal
investigators {start their investiga
tion. which it Is planned to start
early after the beginning of the new
year. It will function as a wrench
thrown Into the machinery
('?ad It Ions Not Normal.
It is known that the school system
has always been open to full investi-j
gatlon by anyone. Even in a normal
time there would be no fear o? hav- j
lng the Federal representativea com
ing In and make any examination they j
wished. But. It is pointed out. these,
people whom the government Intends!
to send Into the local system to ex- ;
amine it will only find conditions so
different from those of normal times
that they absolutely cannot make fair
judgment and recommendations. ,
It is known that the school official*
are watching with no little Interest
for the announcement by the United
States Bureau of Education of the
personnel of the proposed board which
will look Into the school system. They
are watching to see whether It Is to
be composed of people who are likely
to make a fair investigation of the
local school system.
While the business and civic In
terests are planning a drjve before
Congressional committee* to obtain
sufficient funds with which to relieve
local school troubles, school officials
are formulating their plans for going
before Congress. They are collect
ing facta and data to show the actual
conditions In the system and ask for
relief.
dubatltate Teseber Problem.
One of the serious problems
which has caused much worry to
the school directors and which is
being given much attention is that
of substitute teachers. So uncer
tain is the Income and so small
that it has been difficult to find
teachers to take classes on days
when the regular teacher was ab
sent. There are many cases where
children from the grades have been
taken from their school work and
sent into the class rooms to at
tempt to instruct children in the
lower grade.*.
This is not a fault of the school
directors. They are powerless to
prevent It under the prevailing
conditions.
And don't blame the substitute.
Here is what she gets for her work
and she must wait until some
teacher is compelled to stay home
before she collects. She gets paid
only for actual time in the session
room.
For every day that she sub
stitutes In the kindergarten. *1?

who has not spent so many years

CENTRAL AGENCY
Gen. Tasker H. Bliss De
I
clares Food Plentiful, i
Distribution Lacking. I
GERMAN POWER GONE|
American Military Repre
sentative Suggests Cure
For Bolshevists.
Europe if practically self-sustain-.
ing. and therefore Hands in little,
need of assistance from the United \
States. She has plenty of food.'
but the individual nations are hold-J
in* fast to it. and consequently If.
is not being distributed in. such aj
way as to bring the needed relief."^
This was revealed yesterday by
Gen. Tasker H. Bliss. American mil-j
itary representative in Europe dur-j
ins the war and member of the
American peace del* nation, who re
turned home last week.
In a talk to newspaper corre
spondents. Gen. Bliss, reviewing
present-day conditions existing in
the lands which were but recently
war-torn, practically exploded the,
theory that if Europe is to survive,
she must be fed by America.
I'lenty of Sopplle*.
"There is ?pi enty of food in Europe." 1
the general asserted, "but there is
no way now of getting it where it
is wanted. All nationas are holding
on to what they have, and this is
true also of their coal supplies."
To solve the problem with which
Europe thus is confronted. Gen. Bliss
set forth a plan of his own. As
the appointment of Foch in supreme
command of the allied armies was
a factor in winning the war, he be
lieved the appointment of a chief
executive to co-ordinate the issues
and demands of food, food trans
portation and food distribution would
solve the present after-the-war prob
lem of the ai'.ied countries.
Sees Democracy Triumphant.
Speaking of the coming development
of Europe, Gen. Bliss said:
"The conditions in France are very j
good and there, as in most other Eu
ropean countries, now, the govern
ments are really run by the people to .
a gi eater extent than ever before in ,
the history of the world. The people. 1
as such, have been held down more or 1
less in former tmes, but that situation !
is being sensibly changed and demo- j
eratization is m iking great progress.
The soldier vote, for instance, in |
France, has been' overwhelmingly in 1
favor of the real democracy at home j
because of the individual conviction
of the soldier that he was voting for
a government that could preserve or
der and furnish him and his depend
ent* all the rights of freemen "
Gen. Bliss maintains that there Is
not much merit in the notion that
Germany can become a menace again,
either commercially or in the military
sense.
German Menace Gone.
"The menace of Germany as a mill-!
tary power is gone," he said, "and I \
do not see how she can be a danger!
commercially. She was a mere shell
when she collapsed and it will be long
before she will be able to pay her
obligations to the allies, and in the
meantime she will be kept down as a
military power by the provisions of

U. S. School Survey
Viewed as Calamity
While school officials of this city
are doing: everything possible to
prevent the local school system
from collapsing under the heavy
strain of overcrowding and the
scarcity of teachers, there seems to
be a wMI-grounded fear in school
circles that the proposed local sur
vey by the United States Bureau of
Education will aggravate rather than
hefp the situation.
None of the school officials would
discuss the problem from this point
of view, but there appears to be an
under current of feeling that this
is not the time for a survey by the
Federal bureau.
All those attempting to maintain
the present school structure during
the existing crisis, from the super
intendent down to the kind^rgarten
teacher, are laboring under a heavy
strain. For a group of Federal sur
veyors to come Into the situation
now and attempt to examine the
situation might tend to so stir up
conditions that the system would be
sorely taxed to survive, it is con
tended by those familiar with school
conditions.
The proposed Federal survey, it is
asserted, will take the minds of
' ?
school employes from the serious
work of running the system to con
centrate on the survey in an at- i
t?mpt to follow its course and fore
cast results.
Then the question comes up to'
those seriously concerned about the
situation as it exists as to whether
this is the proper time for a sur
vey. An examination made at the
I moment when it is admitted con
ditions are abnormal is not a time
I to look into a question and attempt |
ot draw logical conclusions. Any
thin? done now in this connection
I will be of no value. It is held. In
I attempting ti> lay out a proper
| course for the school system to
I travel in coming: year*.
Matter off Maney.
In all circles?school, business and
civic?it is now admitted that every
| one knows, without any further in
vestigation, that the prime needs off
the local system today are sufficient
funds with which to provide In
creased salaries for the teachers,
money for more teachers, and more
and modem buildings.
All interests are uniting to make a

LOSES HIS PALS
?
Col. Kroll Hasn't a Thing to
Do After Noon on Day
Before Christmas.
Gay little <>upid. who wants to be
: the friend df everybody. was given j
the cold shoulder at the Court House
i yesterday afternoon.
j For Col. William A. Kroll, Dan>
! right hand mao in the District, who
| hands out the marriage licenses, sat
| around all afternoon dolefully wait
i ing for " something" to turn up
I It was the first time Col. Kroll re
[ members that such a thing didn't turn
up on the day before Christmas. The
colonel had hustled to the office early
In the morning with expectations of
an unprecedented rush on the mar
riage license counter. It had been
1 raided on the two days before and the
'colonel believed, from long experience,
that the day before Christmas would
be the biggest day of the year,
i It was a humdinger of a morning.
iThe colonel, who Ifkes his job. joyfully
handed out more licenses than had
jbeen issued during the whole day laat
lyear and thought himself well on the
way to a remarkable record. It
'seemed like everybody in town wanted
'to get married Christmas Day.
! But. lo and behold, there came a"
sudden lull about noon and nary one
'victim of the well-known bow and
farrow showed up after 2 o'clock,
j Ministers throughout the city to
day will be finishing the plentiful
j work begun during the last three
idays by Cupid and Cdl. Kroll. Tal
I lying up yesterday, the colonel found
j that forty more licenses had been
i issued during this period than were
(given out during the same time last
year, and this year a half day was
lost.
J Col. Kroll was unable to explain
'the queer halt in the license bureau
!rush.
J Looking over his records, he noted ,
! with keen satisfaction that ?.3&C li-j
J censes had been issued so far this
jyear. against fi.306 uuring all of 1918. ,

Charles J. Dulin, charged with!

day morning when without apparent
provocation he was shot and dan
gerously wounded by Abraham Fat

i John Marshal place.
Patton was taken to the Police
Court shortly after he gave himseii

held there, charged with assault
with intent to kill, under $10,000
bond. /
Physicians believe Barknett will
I recover. ..
Barknett. on a cot at the hospi
tal. last night gave his version of
jthe shooting:
I "I was awakened at S o'clock to
1 go to work." he said. "I was sit
! ting up in b**d. half asleep, when I
heard a revolver shot. I laughed.
"Then I heard the old man. whose
i bed was opposite mine, saying. *i
;don't feel very well this morning.' I
was so sleepy I could hardly see.
Two more shots, and I felt the bul
i lets hit me is my chest and my
le?.
"My clothes were set on fire by
the bullets. 1 ran downstairs, scarce
ly knowing what I was doing, and
half erax*v1 with pain. Somebody
grabbed hold of me, put out the tire
and took ine up to a room What
became of the old man?"
When brough< to police headquar
ters to be questioned. Patton com
plained that he had been annoyed
J by negroes, who at different times
I held him up and assaulted hAm..
I He apparently was fearful of liv

What is Washington eating to-j
day?
A survey of Washington markets
last night showed that turkey, the
king of Christmas birds, is con*!
spicuoutily absent.
For this year, at least, geese,
ducks, chickens ? and rabbits have
supplanted the majestic fowl.
It was a common sight yesterday
to see a' well-dressed householder
lean across the counter at a market,
glance around to see. that he was
not being watched and whisper
"rabbits" in the ear of the dealer.
Ducks, chickens and geese were)
sold at from 50 to 60 cents a pound.!
Roasting pigs, those relics from thei
old-time (English Christmas, were j
obtainable for $10 each.
Oysters, which form an essential j
element in many Christmas dinners.!
were offered for $1.50 to $2.50 a
gallon.

salesmen stamped their feet, beat

ABOUT 'RIVALRY'
Navy Secretary Hasn't Re
plied to Admiral Sims'.
Letter Refusing Medal.
\ ?
There wan a period of calm yes
terday in the storm that has arisen
In the Navy Department over the
refusal of Admiral 81ms. Commander
Jn-Chief of the American fortes In
the North Sea, to accept the Dis
tinguished 'service Medal awarded
him by Secretary of the Navy Dan
iels and hia protest against the find
ings of both the Board of Award
and the Secretary In the cases of
other naval officers he had recom
mended for the same honor.
Secretary Daniels has not replied
to the letter of protest sent htm by
Admiral Sims, and he was unpre
pared yesterday to say when l>'?
would answer the charges of the
admiral, who now is head of the
Naval Wnr College at Newport.
Mr. Daniels expressed regret that
rivalry over navy decorations should
mar the Christmas spirit In the serv
"I regret deeply," he said, "that
the spirit of rivalry among the mem
bers of the navy, atfer the navy a
wonderful work in the war, should
mar the spirit of Christmas I acted
conscientiously in approving th-'
awards, and I am In favor of not
only rewarding the captain of a ves
sel which did great service in the
war with suitable honors, but I be
lieve every member of the crew
should likewise get the same dec
oration.
"In awarding honors to the com
mander he should not forget that
while he is personally being com
mended for distinguished service, the
award should likewise be considered
a token of the gallantry of the men
who served under him."
In reality President Wilson should
the the donar of all war mednls.i but
because of the magnitude of the ta?K
the dutv has been delegated to both
the Secretary of War and the Secre
tary of Navy. %
Secretary Daniels did not attempt
to minimize his distaste at *h<;
existing In navy ci.clcs. which
termed -pathetic." Yhen the war was
in progress, he said, the chief qual
itita exhibited by the service men
were ?stick-together" ones, and he
said he did not relish them being sup
planted by the present envy. All told,
according to the Secretary, reco.n
mendations had been made for ap
proximately decorations. Mr.
Daniels said: ... .
? It is mighty hard to ferhet out Just
who does and who does nott
awards. It is too bad that this dis
cussion should come a' this time.
Rivalry take* the bloom off the navy s
gallant war record/'

BID OF $750,000IS OFFERED FOR DEMPSEY-CARPENTIER BATTLE?EASTERN BEATS ALUMNI
Griffs to Play Two Games
In Cincinnati if Proper
Bookings Can Be Made
By GEORGE L MORELAND.
President Griffith was hustling yesterday getting ready for his
Christmas duties at home, but he found time to answer a few ques
tions, and they will be pleasing to the fans.
The first one was that there is a possibility that the Nationals
nay play two games in Cincinnati, the first on Saturday. April 3. and
on the following day, Sunday.
He stated that he had just received a letter from Busineses Man
ager Bancroft suggesting that the two teams play in Cincinnati on
these days. Should this arrangement be completed it will mean a
bundle of coin for the Nationals, as it would be the opening games of
the season in Redville, and as the Reds haVe not been seen on the
borne grounds since they won the world's series it means two large
crowds. * ?
Ptaj at Miami. *
He has also received a suggestion
from Bancroft that sounds good and
If the deal is completed it will mean
that the Nationals will go to Miami
and play a couple of game* at the
training camp of the Reds. Then the
two teams will stop off at Palm
Reach on the way North and after
Playing at that famous resort a game
will be played at Jacksonville and the
two clubs would then journey over
to Tampa where two games will be
played on the Nationals' training
grounds.
After those sames have been played
the two teams will then journey to
ward Cincinnati where the games
above mentioned will be played and ?
then both aggregations will hike
through several small cities toward
Washington where the last two games
wllT be played.
Am the season will open on April
14 tt means that Cincinnati must re
turn home at once in order to get j
rrady for the Jlrst game of the season.
May Open Hone.
President Griffith made the remark
tU&rt he thought that the Nationals
would be scheduled to open at home
again this season. The locals were
away from home for two consecutive
years as an opening attraction at
t ^Philadelphia while the Athletics open
^*^lvthe season here last spring. As
weiWve an opening game coming to
ua I thiak that the schedule commit
tee will allow us what is coming to
ua and have us open here.
In that case it is not likely that we
will have the Athletics again for
we have met them during the past
three consecutive seasons. I hope that
when the schedule is made out that
i*e will be alloted a game here with
the Boston team for they would cer
tainly be a great attraction to open
the season here.
Of coarse there fa nothing definite
in Any of the above statements but I
look for all of them to turn out to be
true.
Contracts la Mail.
President Griffith is busy sending
?ut his contracts and will very soon
liable to give out a list of players
ho is going to take to the training
ramp. Instead of traveling by tiain
?e la thinking of going by water. The
team would depart for Baltimore. ]
where one of the large boats would j
take them to Jacksonville, where the
players would go to Tampa by train.'
GREETINGS.
After all my careful choosing of
the entire sporting card here is j
one I hope will please you.
For it brings my best regards? :
Joyful Christmas to all.
Sporting Editor.
Griffith thinks that the trip by water
would be great as it would give the
boys plenty of exercise as they can
do a lot of work en route. This wjl?
be decided upon later or as soon as
he can see what arrangements can
be made.
President Griffith stated last night
that he knew nothing of the report
that he was to let Schauer go for
Nixon. "First I knew of it was when
I read it. I want the southpaw for my
team and he will l?e on my team or
I will know why. Unless he decided
to retire from baseball he will play
; in Washington.
"I have tried to secure Nixon from
Minneapolis since Cantillon purchased
him from the Western League last
fall. If 1 can arrange some kind of a
trade or an outright purchase I will
take him South with the balance of
the youngsters."
I Nixon lives in Philadelphia and had
a trial a couple of years ago with
[ Brooklyn.
Season's Greetings.
I President Griffith received a postal
card yesterday which pleased him
I very much. It read as follows:
"Christmas Greetings and Best
Wishes for the New Year.
?BILL.Y WEST.
"Pitcher for Nationals, 1S82-84."
The Babe Ruth Red Sox made thir
two homers last season. Who made
the other three?
Clark Griffith and H. H. Frazee
want to trade about every player
they own. while Connie Mack says
'-here's nothing In the barter busi
ness and insists on keeping his en
tire outfit. In a conflagration peo
ple try to save many curious things.
Connie would probably be discovered
tushing from the house carrying the
parrot and a volume of Macauley's
essays.
NATIONALS IN THE RUT
ON LOW-HIT GAME LIST
By GEORGE L. MORELAND.
With the best wishes to President Clark C. Griffith and to all the
fans who follow the team the same, and hoping that the Washington
Baseball Club will win the pennant in 19JO, we will present the tables
of what each club did against the other in way of games in which they
held their opponents to five or less hits.
The Chicago team has the best percentage with .737, having
captured fourteen out of nineteen games. Boston, however, won the
most of these contests with fifteen, although they lost seven.
National* la Rat. <
Washington with eleven won and
fifteen lost is next to last.
The Athletics?I certainly hope they
have better luck next year?were able
to win but one game in which they
blanked their opponents and that
single content was won by Rogers,
a new pitcher in the first game h*?
pitched for his team. The club lost
the extra large number of twenty-one
games in which they failed to score
and I have gone over the entire
weapon's work of the American League
since 1901 and fail to find any record
in which the club failed to win more
than one game of this kind.
Th? table will show you what each
team did against the other.

PLANNED FOR YALE
I
I Now Haven. Dec. 24.?Plans were
1 today announced for a now home row
ing course for Yale oarsmen. Both
the university and the city of New
Haven have a definite scheme for
widening and deepening West River,
giving the ?rews a course about a
I mile and a half in length and wid
I enough for at least two and probab|>
three shells.
I After the channel is deepened it will
'l?e widened for a distance of 8,000 feet,
beginning at Kdgewood avenue, ju
north of the Yale Bowl, continuing
the length of the river to Long lslar?

American colleges as a standard.
. Most of the early season races
now rowed over a course of this dis
tance. either on New Haven harbor,
the Schuylkill or the Housatonie
River above the city of Derby.

Griffs Lifetime Dream **
By GEORGE L MORELAND.
President Clark C. Griffith and his new associates certainly handed
out the surprise of all surprises last night when they gave out the most
startling news ever handed baseball fans of Washington.
The sale of the Nationals, which caused a flurry, is not a marker
to the news that was handed out by the new owners.
It will shake the baseball world. It is nothing more than the'
greatest exchange of players ever heard of in the annals of the game.
The fans will gasp in astonishment and will proclaim Griff "the
greatest man in baseball."

since the time he flrrt learned that
he wai* (coins to h?ve Mr. Richard

busy.
It was. however, the other day
that he decided to go after Ruth and
Scott. As Fraxee announced that
he mould aell any of the players on
his team except Hooper. I wired
him that I would give Johnaon for
Ituth and Scott and $25,000. Man
?(??-r Da.rrows then came to Wash
ington yesterday and we closed the
deal, except that we were compelled
to (five up $50,000 instead of $25,000.
Then I wired to Jennings that I
would accept his offer by giving up
Sam Rice. Joe Judg'-. Howard
Shanks and Plchinich. and $2i.0??#

night. Then after that ! got busy
for a man I have always wanted,
and one 1 think is the greatest m

President Grifflfli stated that I o

is one of the finest men connected
with the (fame, besides beinc the
greatest pit* her ever seen on any
diamond. But Boston would not let
their two stars co for anything els.\

1 have been after Col?b for two
years and wli?n 1 learned that he and
Jennings could not agree I decided
that I would try for him. When I met
Hugh at the league meeting we talked
over the d?al and he said he woul I
make me an offer and send inc a ll^t
of players he Vould let go and w hat
he wanted was sent to me This offer
reached me only the other day.
As soon as 1 closed the Boston deal.
T then went after the Tigers. w*th
the result that it was closed as soom
as Jennings received word that I had
accepted his offer.
Then 1 started in for O'Neill, it was
the hardest pnrt of the business. fo?v
Cleveland did not w ant to l'-t him go. g
