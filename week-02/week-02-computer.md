### The Command Line

Note: I've adopted this from Ian Milligan and James Baker, "Introduction to the Bash Command Line": <https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/intro-to-bash>.


`cd --`: This brings you to the "root" directory of your computer.

`cd ..`: This brings you "up" one level in a directory

`mkdir intro-dh`: Makes a new directory

`mkdir week-02`
